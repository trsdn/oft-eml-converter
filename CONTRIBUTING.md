## Code Style Guidelines

### Python Code Style

- Follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) style guidelines
- Use 4 spaces for indentation
- Maximum line length of 88 characters (Black formatter standard)
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### Docstring Style

```python
def convert_oft_to_eml(oft_file_path, eml_file_path=None):
    """
    Convert an OFT file to EML format.
    
    Args:
        oft_file_path (str): Path to the input OFT file
        eml_file_path (str): Path to the output EML file (optional)
        
    Returns:
        str: Path to the created EML file
        
    Raises:
        FileNotFoundError: If the input file doesn't exist
        ValueError: If the file format is invalid
    """
```

### Commit Message Format

Use conventional commit format:
- `feat:` new feature
- `fix:` bug fix
- `docs:` documentation changes
- `test:` adding or updating tests
- `refactor:` code refactoring
- `style:` formatting changes
- `chore:` maintenance tasks

Examples:
- `feat: add support for RTF attachments`
- `fix: handle unicode characters in subject lines`
- `docs: update installation instructions`

## Testing Guidelines

### Writing Tests

- Add tests for all new functionality
- Use descriptive test names: `test_conversion_with_unicode_content`
- Include both positive and negative test cases
- Mock external dependencies when appropriate

### Test Structure

```python
def test_feature_description(self):
    """Test that feature works correctly under specific conditions."""
    # Arrange
    input_data = create_test_data()
    
    # Act
    result = function_under_test(input_data)
    
    # Assert
    self.assertEqual(expected_result, result)
```

### Running Tests

Our CI/CD pipeline runs tests on:
- **Operating Systems**: Ubuntu, Windows, macOS
- **Python Versions**: 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12

Make sure your changes work across all supported platforms.
